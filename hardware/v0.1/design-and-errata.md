# Bed lift v0.1 (OBSOLETE)

**Status: Superseded by v0.2, see [errata](#errata)**

## Design synopsis

This initial prototype of the bed lift was built on protoboard with components on-hand.  It uses an RP2040 and two DRV8874 motor drivers to synchronize the movement of two linear actuators for lifting the bed.  It lacks servo drivers to extend the bed sideways.
